## Developers

VoidCore is built on [Azure Pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/void-type/VoidCore/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master) and released on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=voidcore&prerel=false).

To work on VoidCore, you will need the [.Net Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

You will also need some global tools. To install them easily, just run the following:

```powershell
cd build/
./installAndUpdateTools.ps1
```

See the /build folder for scripts used to test and build this project.

There are [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) tasks for each script. The build task (ctrl + shift + b) performs the standard CI build.
